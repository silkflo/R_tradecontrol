# PURPOSE: Analyse trade results in Terminal 1 and Trigger or Stop Trades in Terminal 3
# DETAILS: Trades are analysed and RL model is created for each single Expert Advisor
#        : Q states function is calculated, whenever Action 'ON' is > than 'OFF' trade trigger will be active   
#        : Results are written to the file of the MT4 Trading Terminal
#        : Reinforcement Learning Models are created for each specific system considering 6 Market Types
#        : RL would learn to select the best Market Types to switch ON/OFF Trading Systems


# packages used *** make sure to install these packages
library(tidyverse) #install.packages("tidyverse")
library(lubridate) #install.packages("lubridate") 
library(ReinforcementLearning) #devtools::install_github("nproellochs/ReinforcementLearning")
library(magrittr)

# ----------- Main Steps -----------------
# -- Read trading results from Terminal 1
# -- Rearrange data for RL
# -- Perform Reinforcement Learning or Update Model with New Data
# -- Start/Stop trades in Terminal 3 based on New Policy
# -- Start/Stop trades on Terminals at MacroEconomic news releases (will be covered in Course #5)

# ----------- TESTS -----------------
# -- Select entire content of the script and execute
# -- Pass: Data object DFT1 contains observations
# -- Pass: DFT1_sum contains trades summary
# -- Pass: Files SystemControlXXXXXXX.csv are generated in the Terminal 3 sandbox
# -- Pass: If file "01_MacroeconomicEvent.csv" exists trade policy is overwritten
# -- Fail: DFT1 class 'try-error'
# -- Fail: xxx
